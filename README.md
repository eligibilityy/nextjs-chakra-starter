# Next.js Boilerplate

This template is pretty much what I'm gonna be using for my actual portfolio which I'm working on.

*This whole thing is made in Javascript and I'm sorry*

### Stack  & Others

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/)
- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)
- [Lanyard API](https://github.com/Phineas/lanyard/) - For Discord integration in [one of the components](./LanyardBreakdown.md). *(optional)*

You are free to expand on the initial deps, obviously.
